The canonical EDA content has been consolidated into `EDA.md` to provide a single authoritative document. Please open `EDA.md` for the full executive summary, detailed findings, and recommendations derived from `notebooks/EDA.ipynb`.

This file is retained only as a lightweight pointer. All references in the repository have been updated to point to `EDA.md`.
